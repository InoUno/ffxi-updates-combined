<p>Search comment categories have been divided.<br>
The previous four categories have been divided into seven: EXP party, Mission, Quest, Battlefield, Item, Synthesis, and Others. Newly added subcategories such as Seek Party and Find Member allow for more specific comments and searches. </p>
<p>New text commands for setting search comments have been added.<br>
There are two steps to setting a search comment using text commands. First, compose a comment of up to 3 lines using /seacom. Second, set a category and subcategory with /seacomup to register the comment.<br>
　<br>
1. Composing a Search Comment<br>
<br>
/seacom (/sc) [line no.] &quot;[mes.]&quot;<br>
<br>
Search comments can be up to 3 lines long. Enter the line number of the search comment window, and then type your message.<br>
If you wish to enter spaces before the message, the entire message must be enclosed in quotation marks.<br>
<br>
Example :<br>
/seacom 1 Hello!<br>
/seacom 2 Invite me to your party!<br>
/sc 3 &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please!&quot;<br>
<br>
The first, second, and third lines of the search comment window will be entered as &quot;Hello!&quot;, &quot;Invite me to your party!&quot;, and &quot;     Please!&quot;, respectively.<br>
At this point, your comment has yet to be registered and will not be displayed in searches. This is accomplished by setting the category name and subcategory number with the /seacomup command.<br>
<br>
<span class="Tx12r">* Messages cannot exceed 40 characters for each line. Lines longer than 40 characters will be truncated.</span><br>
<br>
2. Registering a Search Comment<br>
<br>
/seacomup (/scu) [category name] [subcat. no.]<br>
Category names and subcategory numbers are as follows :
<br>
<br>

-Category Names<br>
expparty, mission, quest, item, synthesis, battlefield, others<br>
<br>
-Subcategory Numbers<br>
1 Seek Party, Want to Sell, Need Made<br>
2 Find Member, Want to Buy, Can Make<br>
3 Other<br>
<br>
Example :<br>
/seacomup expparty 1<br>
<br>
Your search comment will be registered under Seek Party within Expparty, and will be displayed in searches involving these categories. <br>
<br>
<span class="Tx12r">* If no category is specified, the message will be registered in Others. If no subcategory is specified, the message will be registered in 3 (Other).</span><br>
</p>
<p>Chat filters have been refined to allow separate settings for NPCs you are currently fighting and other NPCs.<br>
It is now possible to separate NPCs with red names (those you are currently fighting) from NPCs with yellow or purple names (other NPCs) within the chat filter settings. This means that you can view log messages concerning the NPC you are fighting without interruption from other NPC actions.</p>
<p>The names for several chat filters have been changed. Their respective functions remain the same.</p>
<p>When entering the Mog House, the camera will now move to a position behind 
the character.</p>
<p>An issue concerning the screen remaining dark when entering or leaving the Mog House has been addressed.</p><br>

The log window messages concerning the monster abilities Tortoise Song, Goblin Dice, and Dispelling Wind are occasionally inaccurate.</div><br>
