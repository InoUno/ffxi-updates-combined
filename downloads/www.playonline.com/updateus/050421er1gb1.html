<div class="imgdiv3">Please note that at the time of the version update, if your character has more EXP than the new amount required, your EXP total will be adjusted to 1 point less than the amount needed for level up.
<br><br>
Example:<br>
Player status before the version update -> Level=51 EXP=8100<br>
Amount needed for level up (before update) = 10000<br>
Amount needed for level up (after adjustment) = 8000<br>
Player status after the version update -> Level=51 EXP=7999<br>
