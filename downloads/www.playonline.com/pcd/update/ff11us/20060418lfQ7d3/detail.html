Acquiring Blue Magic<br> Blue magic is acquired by “learning” the special abilities of monsters.

Using Blue Magic<br>Unlike other magic spells, it is not possible to use blue magic as soon as it is acquired. First, the spells you wish to use must be “set.”<br>Using the system described below, you can freely assign the spells you wish to use.<br class="floatEnd">

1. Point Total/Maximum<br>Each blue magic spell is assigned a point value (blue magic points). The level of the blue mage determines the maximum number of points available for setting spells.<br class="floatEnd">
</p>
<p class="tx2">
2. Maximum Number of Set Spells<br>The maximum number of blue magic spells that can be set at one time is also determined by the blue mage&#39;s level. This maximum number may decrease when the blue mage is under a level restriction and so the set numbers are assigned a color for easy reference. <br><br>Blue Magic Points and Max.

Acquiring Phantom Rolls<br>The Phantom Roll ability is learned at level 5. However, in order to use this ability, corsairs must use “dice“ to learn various rolls, in much the same way scrolls are used to learn spells. Acquired rolls will appear in a sub-menu after selecting Phantom Roll.<br class="floatEnd">
</p>
<p class="tx1">
<img class="imgr" src="18.jpg" border="1" alt="image">
Using Phantom Roll<br>When the Phantom Roll ability is used, a number (in roman numerals) from “I” to “VI” is generated and party members within range gain the effect of the roll. The number displayed affects the degree of the roll&#39;s effect.<br class="floatEnd">

<p class="tx2">
<img class="imgr" src="19.jpg" border="1" alt="image">
- Double-Up<br>For 45 seconds after using a Phantom Roll, the corsair will have the option of using the Double-Up ability. This period of time is represented by the “Double-Up Chance” icon.<br>Using Double-Up will once again generate a number from “I” to “VI,” which is then added to the total of the previous roll.<br><br><span class="co2">*Corsairs can continue to use the Double-Up ability as long as the Double-Up Chance icon remains.</span><br><br>- Phantom Roll totals<br> The effect of a roll will continue to increase as the total rises from “I” to “XI.” However, if the total reaches “XII” or more, the roll will “Bust.”<br> Each Phantom Roll has a lucky and unlucky number. Obtaining a total equal to a roll’s lucky number will produce an effect second only to a total of “XI.” A total equal to the unlucky number will produce an effect weaker than a total of “I.”<br> If the roll becomes a “Bust,” party members will lose the effect of the roll and the corsair will experience an additional penalty.<br><span class="co2">*A “Bust” will reduce the number of possible active Phantom Rolls by one, as well as inflict a detrimental effect corresponding to a “Bust” roll.</span><br><br>- Special effects of Phantom Roll<br>The effect of a Phantom Roll will be enhanced depending on the type of roll and the main jobs of party members. For example, when a Fighter’s Roll is used, the effect of the roll will be greater if a warrior is in the party.<br><br>- Things to consider when using Phantom Roll<br><br>Characters with corsair set as a main job can have a <br>maximum of two active Phantom Rolls, while those with corsair as a support job are limited to one active Phantom Roll effect.<br><br>The Phantom Roll effects of a character with corsair set as a support job are weaker, and do not gain the bonus effect from the presence of the applicable main job in the party.<br><br>A Phantom Roll effect cannot be reapplied until after it has worn off or been removed.<br><span class="co2">*As of the July version update of 2006, a character using bard songs and the corsair ability Phantom Roll is able to stack up to 3 effects on each party member.<br>However, a single character is only able to receive up to a total of 12 combined Phantom Roll and bard song effects.</span><br class="floatEnd">
