<p class="tx2">
-About Fish Ranking<br>A certain variety of fish will be specified for each Fish Ranking contest. Players who wish to participate must obtain the fish and trade it to Chenon. The participant whose entry best fits the conditions set forth in the contest rules will be declared victorious.<br>Contest entries for Fish Ranking will be accepted for a period of two weeks (Earth time). After the competition is over, the results will be announced for the next two-week period. This cycle will continue so that the event is held twelve times a year.<br><br>-Conditions for Participation<br>Anybody can participate as long as he or she possesses the fish specified by Chenon. There are also no rules regarding the method of acquiring the fish. You can catch it yourself, buy it at the auction house, or search other players’ bazaars.<br><br>-Rules<br>Three rules determine what kind of fish to seek for the contest.<br><br>&lt;Standard Rules of Evaluation&gt;<br>Rule A: Type of Fish<br>The first rule specifies the variety of fish to be used for the contest.<br>Rule B: Fish Specifications<br>The second rule specifies whether the fish will be evaluated based on its weight, size, or both.<br>Rule C: Large vs. Small<br>The third rule specifies whether the fish with the greatest value or the smallest value of weight/size will be declared the winner.<br><br>Speak to Chenon while entries are being accepted to learn the rules for the current competition.<br><br>-How to Participate<br>Trade the fish specified for the contest to Chenon during the submission period to participate in Fish Ranking.<br><br><span class="co2">*Note</span><br>-You must pay a small registration fee in order to submit an entry.<br>-You cannot view other players’ fishing records during the submission period.<br>-You can only have one submission entered into the contest at a time. You may submit new entries, but please note that any new entry will remove the previous submission from the contest.<br>-Any fish that have been entered in a Fish Ranking competition will be labeled and will be unusable for future contests. However, no other changes to the fish will be made, and it may be used in any other typical way, such as selling, cooking, and quests. However, if a labeled fish is sold, it will not lose its mark, and will continue to be unavailable for contest entry.<br><br>-The Submission Period<br>During the submission period, you may confirm or withdraw your entry at any time at no extra cost. However, please take note that you cannot resubmit an entry that has been withdrawn.<br><br>-Ranking Results<br>The results will be announced following the two-week submission period. Speak to Chenon to view the ranking board.<br>The ranking board lists rank, tier, the participant’s name, and entry details.　In the case of a tie, the tied rank will be listed twice, and the list will skip the following number.

However, the player will no longer be eligible for an award after the announcement period ends, so it is important to accept your prize in a timely fashion. If your inventory is full, you will be unable to accept your reward. If you do not make space in your inventory and accept your prize before the announcement period is over, you will not be able to receive it at a later time.<br><br>-Additional Notes<br>&gt;All ranking results are erased at the end of the announcement period. However, you can view the number of awards received in each tier using the “View award history” option.<br>&gt;You can revert to any previously received title by speaking to a bard in the town where the title was originally earned.<br class="floatEnd">

</p>
<p class="tx2">
-If a player is KO'd or moves to a new area while fighting a monster outside the radius that it remains within when not engaged in battle, the monster will not begin attacking others in the surrounding area.

In addition, the monster that reappears will be the exact same monster that disappeared, and not another monster of the same type.<br>This rule will not apply to notorious monsters.
